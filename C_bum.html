        IFBB professional bodybuilder born in Ontario, Canada.<br><br>

        Mr. Olympia has won the classic physique event for five consecutive times since 2019<br><br>
        
        Since I was a child, I have been playing various sports such as basketball and ice hockey, but I feel limited at the age of 14 and I will find something I am good at. I quit sports and started going to gym, and I found that I was strong and that weight training was good for me. When he reached the age of 18 over four years, he met his sister's boyfriend, Ian Belier, who praised his muscles and suggested becoming a bodybuilder, and he started bodybuilding under his coaching.
